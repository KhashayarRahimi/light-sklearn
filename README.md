This repository contains implementations of various machine learning algorithms from scratch in Python. Each algorithm is coded from the ground up, providing a deeper understanding of how these algorithms work under the hood. The implemented algorithms include:

Linear Regression
Ridge Regression
Lasso Regression
Logistic Regression
Naive Bayes Classifier
Decision Trees
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
K-Means Clustering
Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)

Additionally, an example script demonstrating the usage of these algorithms on a sample dataset is provided. This example serves as a guide on how to utilize these implementations for real-world data analysis and modeling tasks.

I hope you find it helpful and make it better.
